## 📖 Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Setting Up Your First Monitor

#### Step 1: Accept the Disclaimer

When you first open SafeOS, you'll see our critical disclaimer. Read it carefully:

> **SafeOS is NOT a replacement for human supervision.**
> This is a supplementary tool only.

Click "I Understand and Accept" to continue.

#### Step 2: Choose a Monitoring Profile

Select what you're monitoring:

| Profile | Best For | What It Watches |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 🐕 **Pet** | Dogs, cats, small animals | Eating, bathroom, distress, illness |
| 👶 **Baby** | Infants, toddlers | Crying, movement, breathing, safety |
| 👴 **Elderly** | Seniors, dementia patients | Falls, confusion, prolonged stillness |

#### Step 3: Allow Camera & Microphone

Click "Start Monitoring" and allow browser permissions:
- **Camera**: Required for visual monitoring
- **Microphone**: Optional but recommended for audio alerts

#### Step 4: Position Your Camera

For best results:
- Place camera at eye level with the subject
- Ensure good lighting (avoid backlighting)
- Keep the entire area of interest in frame
- Stable mounting reduces false motion alerts

#### Step 5: Adjust Sensitivity

In the sidebar, adjust:
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Higher = more alerts on movement
- **Audio Sensitivity**: Higher = more alerts on sounds
- **Alert Volume**: How loud escalating alerts play

## 🎛️ Configuration Guide

|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Immediate | 20% | Soft chime |
| 2 | +30 sec | 40% | Gentle alert |
| 3 | +1 min | 60% | Standard alarm |
| 4 | +2 min | 80% | Urgent alarm |
| 5 | +3 min | 100% | Maximum |

**Acknowledge alerts** at any time to stop escalation.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Pet Monitoring
- Position camera to see food/water bowls
- Include litter box area if monitoring cats
- Use "low" motion sensitivity for sleeping pets
- Enable audio for barking/meowing detection

### For Baby Monitoring
- Camera should see the crib clearly
- Audio sensitivity is crucial for cry detection
- Enable "breathing pattern" detection
- Use nightlight for low-light visibility

### For Elderly Care
- Cover common areas (living room, bathroom entrance)
- Higher motion sensitivity for fall detection
- Set inactivity alerts (e.g., 30 min no movement)
- Include audio for distress calls

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Ollama not connected"

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# If not, start it
ollama serve
```

### "Camera not working"

1. Check browser permissions (🔒 icon in address bar)
2. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
3. Ensure no other app is using the camera

### "Slow analysis"

- First analysis takes longer (model loading)
- Subsequent analyses are faster
- Cloud fallback activates if local is too slow

### "Too many false alerts"

1. Lower motion sensitivity in settings
2. Adjust audio threshold
3. Ensure stable camera mounting
4. Check for moving objects in frame (curtains, shadows)
